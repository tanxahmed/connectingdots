### 09-22-2013

Mariano Rivera’s last day of baseball.  The main reason I was able to attend this once-in-a-lifetime event was because of my brother.  He had tickets, and I went with him, his wife and his wife's family.  The thing that I remember most was feeling a bit down on things, unfortunately.  My mood had nothing to do with the game, or the people that I was with.  I think I was just a bit overwhelmed, overstressed, and overworked by the NYC lifestyle.  By that point, it was about 15 months in.  I feel like I was a bit fed up with the work culture, rudeness, dating, social life, drinking, attempts at fitting in, adapting to the various social circles and dealing with general criticisms. And that recently concluded summer did make me feel a bit down and disappointed. I just felt that I wasn't good enough for NYC.  

In hindsight, I feel bad about bringing that kind of energy to the game; I feel that it was contagious and everyone that I was with felt my vibe.  I wasn't practicing mindfulness and compartmentalizing around those days.  I just carried my mood with me wherever I went.  If I could go back, I would have tried to stay in the moment, appreciate my brother's generosity in bringing me to a Yankee Legend's last game, enjoy the time with my sister-in-law's family (who I think are fantastic people), and understand that the future-me will think that 2013 was one great year (and I will look back with fondness despite the negativity).  

Anyways, I hate that that is the first thing that pops up when I see this picture.  Besides my angst that day, I do remember the spectacle around Rivera’s last game.  Tons of celebrities were there, Metallica performed(!), and everyone in the audience carried a huge, celebratory energy.  It was my second Yankee game ever, and it was the game that made me realize and appreciate just how important the team is to the city.  I love Yankee culture and how it symbolizes New York City so well.  I am very grateful to have been able to attend that game.  Thanks Sy.
